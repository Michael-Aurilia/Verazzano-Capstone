//This file needs the most changes: Implement speed for turn order, JavaFX, Highest priority on switching Pokemon or using items, User and computer having six Pokemon,
//Battle only ends once a whole team has fainted, Only not fainted Pokemon can battle, Status moves?(Probably not), No running away
