# Verazzano-Capstone

This is my capstone project for the Verazzano Honors program.
The code is a text based 6v6 Pokemon battle against a smart Computer Player that targets your Pokemon's weaknesses. Here is how to run the program if you want to play:

1.) Download each of the included code files
2.) Download a program to run java files
3.) Use the run function on the PokemonRunner.java file
4.) Read the instructions and enjoy!
